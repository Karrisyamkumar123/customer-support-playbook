"This document covers everything from basic procedures to advanced escalation protocols. Take 15 minutes to read through it and understand the structure."

[1:00 - 1:30] CUSTOMIZING TEMPLATES
"Next, let's customize the templates for your company. Open 2_Templates/Email_Templates.md."

[Show email templates file]
"You'll need to replace all the placeholder text with your company information. Look for brackets like [Company Name] and [Your Name] - these need to be updated with your actual information."

[Show specific examples of placeholders]
"Update the company name, contact information, escalation contacts, and any specific procedures that don't match your current setup."

[1:30 - 2:00] SETTING UP DATA TRACKING
"Now let's set up your data tracking. Open 4_Data_Tracking/Issues_Database.csv."

[2:00 - 2:30] TEAM TRAINING
"Once you've customized the templates, it's time to train your team. Start with the Quick Reference guide in 1_Documentation/Quick_Reference.md."

[Show quick reference file]
"This is a one-page summary that your team can reference daily. Print it out and keep it handy. Then schedule a 2-hour training session to walk through the main playbook and practice with the templates."

[2:30 - 3:00] IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE
"Here's your implementation timeline: Week 1, customize and train. Week 2, pilot with a small group. Week 3, full rollout. Week 4, optimize based on feedback."

[Show timeline on screen]
"Don't try to implement everything at once. Start with the basics and gradually add more advanced features."

[3:00 - 3:30] TROUBLESHOOTING
"If you run into issues, check the troubleshooting section in 6_Instructions/README.md. Common problems include templates not matching your needs, confusion about escalation procedures, and data tracking setup issues."

[Show troubleshooting section]
"The solutions are all documented there, along with contact information for additional support."
